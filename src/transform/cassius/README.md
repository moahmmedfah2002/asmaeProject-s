#Notes on CaSSius support

CaSSius is a JATS XML to PDF typesetter. You can find full details of the project at the [CaSSius page](https://github.com/MartinPaulEve/CaSSius).

CaSSius support in Janeway can automatically generate PDFs from XML galley uploads. To allow this to happen, you must have a writeable directory "temp" inside your base files folder.
