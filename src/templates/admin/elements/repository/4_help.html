            These emails are similar to mail merges. Text inside curly braces {% verbatim %}{{  }}{% endverbatim %} are filled with information. For example {% verbatim %}{{ preprint.owner.full_name }}{% endverbatim %} will be replaced with the name of the owner of the preprint object. Unless you know what you are changing it is recommended that you do not change the content of the curly braces. Other than that you are free to format the email however you like.
